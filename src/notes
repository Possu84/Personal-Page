Here are the notes.


-- Install react transition group v2

-- Install style-components

React router for routing the different pages and creating the transitions

-- Css did not show.... Resource interpreted as Stylesheet but transferred with MIME type text/html: "http://localhost:8080/styles.css".

    ---> install express

-- Modal did not work. You need to do

{this.state.modal && <Modal />}{" "}

on the router and add this after constructor

this.toggleModal = this.toggleModal.bind(this);
}
toggleModal() {

console.log("toggling the modal");

this.setState({
  modal: !this.state.modal
});
}
